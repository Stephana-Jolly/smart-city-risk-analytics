# 🌍 Smart City Environmental Risk Analytics & Forecasting Platform

## 📌 Overview

Urban cities face increasing environmental risks due to air pollution, impacting public health and operational planning. Most monitoring systems are reactive and lack predictive insights for decision-makers.

This project builds an end-to-end analytics and forecasting platform that integrates environmental data, analyzes city-level risk patterns, forecasts short-term risk, and presents insights through decision-oriented KPIs and dashboards.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

City administrators and policy teams lack predictive and actionable intelligence to assess environmental risk and its potential health impact. Existing systems focus on real-time reporting without trend analysis or forecasting, leading to delayed or reactive decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Develop a data-driven system that:

Quantifies environmental risk at the city level

Identifies seasonal and temporal risk patterns

Forecasts short-term risk levels

Communicates insights clearly for non-technical stakeholders

## 📊 Key KPIs

- Average Pollution Index (by city & time period)

- High-Risk Days (%) above safe limits

- Seasonal Risk Trends

- City-level Risk Comparison

- 7-day Risk Forecast

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

- SQL (data modeling & KPI queries)

- Time Series / ML (ARIMA, Random Forest, XGBoost)

- Tableau / Power BI (dashboarding)

---

## 📈 Outcome

- A production-style analytics repository demonstrating:

- Real-world data handling

- Business-focused analytics

- Predictive modeling

- Decision-friendly reporting
